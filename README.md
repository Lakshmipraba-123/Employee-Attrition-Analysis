# Employee-Attrition-Analysis

📊 Employee Attrition Analysis (Excel Project)
📌 Project Overview

This project focuses on analyzing employee attrition using Excel.
The goal is to understand why employees leave the organization by analyzing different factors such as employee profile, job details, experience, satisfaction, and compensation.

The analysis helps identify key areas where the organization can improve employee retention.

📂 Dataset

The dataset contains employee-level information such as:

Employee number

Gender

Age band

Marital status

Department

Job role

Experience details

Job satisfaction

Monthly income

Attrition status

🧹 Data Cleaning & Preparation

The following data cleaning steps were performed:

Created a new Attrition column using Yes/No values based on employee status.

Cleaned the Age Band column by grouping values like Under 26 and Under 27 into 25–34.

Checked for duplicate employee records and removed duplicates.

Verified all columns for missing or blank values.

Prepared a clean dataset for analysis.

📈 Analysis Performed

The analysis was divided into multiple sections using Pivot Tables and Pivot Charts:

Overall Attrition Rate

Attrition by Gender

Attrition by Age Group

Attrition by Marital Status

Attrition by Department

Attrition by Job Role

Attrition by Years at Company

Attrition by Job Satisfaction

Attrition by Monthly Income

A final Report sheet was created by combining key charts and insights.

🧠 Key Insights (Final Conclusion)

Attrition is higher among early-career employees, especially in the 25–34 age group and employees with fewer years at the company.

Job role, department, and work experience have a clear impact on employee attrition.

Focusing on early employee support, role clarity, satisfaction, and compensation can help reduce attrition.
